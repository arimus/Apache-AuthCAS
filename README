Apache/AuthCAS version 0.2
==========================

The Apache::AuthCAS module allows a user to protect their non-Java content on
an Apache server with the Yale CAS authentication server.

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

    You should run the schema.sql script or an equivalent script using a
    database of your choice to initially create the session and pgt/pgtiou
    tables.  The chosen database name and table names should match the
    parameters configured in either the module itself or the Apache directory
    configuration specified.  This can be done for PostgreSQL like so:

        psql -h <dbhost> -U <dbuser> -f schema.sql <dbname>

    Of course <dbhost>/<dbuser>/<dbname> should be replaced above by the
    settings that match your environment.

    Net:SSLeay
